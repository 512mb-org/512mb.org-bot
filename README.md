# 512mb.org-bot
Yet another 512mb bot. It's running on a discord library for the luvit framework called [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/discordia). For guides on using particular features of the bot check out the [wiki](https://github.com/512mb-org/512mb.org-bot/wiki).

# Self-hosting

2. Install libqalculate and compile luaqalc
3. Place the ``libqalculator.so`` in ./libraries/
4. Get [luvit](https://luvit.io) and run ``bot.lua`` using the ``luvit`` binary
